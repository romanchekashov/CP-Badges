# CP-Badges

What if there are badges on Github profile that show our Codeforces ratings with the rating colour as well?

`So I decided to make my own!`

This repo helps you to create your custom profile badges with Max rating in Codechef, Codeforces and many more.

`Maybe you can flaunt more with your coding badges now.`

You can add custom links also to the badge for reference :

```python
[![Badge](https://cp-logo.vercel.app/codechef/gennady.korotkevich)]
(https://www.codechef.com/users/gennady.korotkevich)
```

This will add a link to the badge

[![Badge](https://cp-logo.vercel.app/codechef/gennady.korotkevich)](https://www.codechef.com/users/gennady.korotkevich)
